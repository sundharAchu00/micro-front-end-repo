        Located in Maine, Bates College is a renowned institution that focuses
        on providing an engaging learning experience in a vibrant, dynamic, and
        accessible community. This college website fully captures the essence of
        its inclusivity from the moment a user lands on the homepage. Bates
        College makes its design simple and embraces white space and minimal
        navigation options to direct visitors to important content. They go
        beyond visual consistency and streamlined navigation with elements like:
        Involvement information: This stunning college website uses its homepage
        to feature four primary involvement opportunities. Each has a button CTA
        to drive action, whether it’s learning more about campus life, exploring
        academic programs, reading about the presidential search, or scheduling
        a virtual visit. Plus, there’s a brief description for each so that
        users know exactly what they’re being asked to do. Fundraisers: Colleges
        and universities can only expand their offerings if they have sufficient
        funding, which is why Bates College has created extensive resources on
        ways its alumni and other community members can give to support its
        success. They even have a dedicated matching gifts page that explains
        how donors can make their gifts go twice as far by checking whether
        their employer offers a matching gift program. Multiple ways to give:
        Beyond accepting one-time cash and credit donations, Bates College
        allows donors to enroll in a recurring giving program, make multi-year
        pledges, recommend grants from a donor-advised fund (DAF), and more. By
        providing all of these details upfront, they can maximize the funds they
        receive by allowing people to support the school in whichever way they
        prefer.
